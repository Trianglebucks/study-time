    title: "Pomodoro Method",
    description: "The Pomodoro study method is a time-management technique that uses a timer to break down your studying into 25-minute (or 45-minute) increments, called Pomodoro sessions. Then, after each session, you’ll take a 5-minute (or 15-minute) break, during which you entirely distance yourself from the study topic. And after completing four such sessions, you’ll take a more extended 15-to-30-minute break.",

    title: "Active Recall",

    description: "Active recall, sometimes called retrieval practice or practice testing, is a study technique involving actively recalling information (rather than just reading or re-reading it) by testing yourself repeatedly. And, remembering and writing down the answer to a flashcard is a lot more effective than thinking you know the answer and flipping the card over early.",
